Severus is an architect. Today he wants to build a quartz-twin-tower.

He has N blocks of quartz, the size of each block is known. He wants to use these blocks of quartz to build the towers. But he is a Virgo. He thinks the two towers must be of the same height. It's a big problem for him.

But you are a programmer, it's a piece of cake for you. So it's the time to show your ability!

---------
##Input

There are multiple test cases. In each case there are two lines.

In the first line there is a integer N(1 \leq N \leq 100), and in the following line there are n integers, indicate the height of the blocks.

------------
##Output

For each case, print the maximum height Severus can build. If he can't build the tower, output "Impossible".
